- Investigate signatures of selection, including:  
  - Reduced nucleotide diversity  (selection_analysis/reduced_nucleotide_diversity)
  - Extended haplotype homozygosity  (selection_analysis/extended_haplotype_homozygosity)
  - Copy number variation  (selection_analysis/copy_number_variation)
- Phylogenetic analysis of candidate genes:

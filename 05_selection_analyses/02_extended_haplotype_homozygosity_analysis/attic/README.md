This repository contains scripts for preparing input files and running extended haplotype homozygosity tests as implemented by [selscan](https://github.com/szpiech/selscan).  
Specifically, the scripts calculate:  
1. The integrated haplotype score (iHS) score.  
2. nSL score.  

### Preparing input files:  
#### Generating haplotype files:  
For both tests, a haplotype file and map file are required.  
The haplotype file consists of a genotype matrix whereby each column represents an individual variant and row represents an individual sample.  
The haplotype file can be generated for each individual chromosome using ```VCF_to_genomatrix_hap.R```.  
The input for the script is a VCF.  

#### Generating genetic maps:  
The implementation of iHS requires both the genetic distance and physical distance between consecutive SNPs.  
The .map file format for the genetic map is required in PLINK format consisting of four columns:  
```
Chromosome_name locus genetic_distance  physical_distance
```
Taking population-scaled recombination rate (rho) values generated by ldhelmet, ```make_genetic_map.R``` converts to centimorgans, which can be used as input for running selscan to calculate iHS scores.  
nSL does not require genetic distance, only physical distance between consecutive SNPs.  

The preparation of files and running selscan is compiled in the script ```preparing_input_files_to_EHH_methods.sh```.

The purpose of the script is to compare the number of high nsl-annotated SNPs:

The most abundant regions where high |nsl| scores are present are within intronic regions
of genes.  

```{r}
## Assign values for each genomic region:
intronic_snps <- 5358
intergenic_snps <- 1860
coding_snps <- 370
total_snps <- 10555
```

Compute proportions:

```{r}
## Comparison between number of high |nsl| values in intronic and coding regions
fisher.test( rbind( c(intronic_snps, total_snps), 
                    c(coding_snps, total_snps)))

## Comparison between number of high |nsl| values in intronic and intergenic regions
fisher.test( rbind( c(intronic_snps, total_snps), 
                    c(intergenic_snps, total_snps)))
```
